#Campus Vehicle Movement Analysis using Edge AI
Overview
Managing vehicle movement and parking on a college campus is critical for security and efficiency. This project aims to develop an Edge AI-based solution to analyze vehicle movement using data from cameras capturing vehicle photos and license plates. The solution provides real-time insights on vehicle movement patterns, parking occupancy, and matches vehicles to an approved database.

Features
Vehicle Movement Patterns: Analyzes frequency and timing of vehicle movement in and out of the campus, identifying peak times and patterns.

Parking Occupancy: Monitors real-time occupancy of parking lots, identifying frequently occupied lots and peak times.

Vehicle Matching: Matches captured vehicle images and license plates to an approved database, identifying unauthorized vehicles.
